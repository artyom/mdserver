Command mdserver is an http server serving directory (recursively) with
markdown (.md) files. If can render automatically built index of those files
and render them as html pages.

Its main use-case is reading through directory with documentation written in
markdown format, i.e. local copy of Github wiki.

To access automatically generated index, request "/?index" path, as
http://localhost:8080/?index.

To create home page available at / either create index.html file or start
server with -rootindex flag to render automatically generated index.

wikis like "https://github.com/user/project/wiki/Page" to relative ones like
"Page.md".
